        This page lists all the countries that we currently support, together with the granularity of the data.
        Click on a country to visualize the data sources for that country. 
        Each source is linked to the file at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/) that is used to import the data.
        If you find some issues with the data, please [report a bug](https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/issues). 
        Suggestions about where to find data that we do not currently provide are also very welcome!
